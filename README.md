How to register your token
Centralized exchanges facilitate trading and manage people’s capital and their private keys. They are a popular choice for all newcomers to the world of cryptocurrencies due to user-friendly platforms. On top of that, they provide certain services such as margin trading and landing. Plus, they stop losses or include wallets for storing your cryptocurrencies. In addition, thanks to their popularity, they offer higher liquidity, allowing you to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies faster.
One of the most significant advantages of CEX over DEX for everyone looking to dabble with crypto for the very first time is that they allow payments via fiat currencies, such as bank wire transfers, as well as credit and debit card payments. Since decentralized exchanges accept only cryptocurrency deposits, CCE is a starting point for almost every crypto trader out there.
Another key aspect to consider when choosing the right exchange is safety. While most user accounts are insured, centralized exchanges have been a lucrative target among many hackers due to their high trade volumes. It is worth mentioning that 5 biggest crypto hacks led to a loss of $1 billion.

Decentralized Exchanges
Decentralized exchanges eliminate the need for a middle-man (centralized exchanges); instead, they operate P2P. One of the biggest benefits of decentralized exchanges is the anonymity they provide. That has to do with the way decentralized exchanges operate — miners validate transfers and your information is only revealed to the buyer/seller if the exchange method involves a bank transfer. At the same time, miners require a much smaller fee than centralized exchanges, which makes DEXs much more appealing.
You must already be wondering why decentralized exchanges are not used as often if they are that much better.
The answer to that question lies in a few disadvantages of DEX over CEX. Namely, decentralized exchanges have a much lower trade volume compared to centralized exchanges, meaning that it will take some time before you can find a buyer/seller. That is a huge disadvantage for anyone looking to make a profit by playing the market. What’s more, due to much smaller liquidity, it might take a while before you can exchange your cryptocurrency into fiat.
However, one thing that decentralized exchanges have going for them is that they aren’t regulated by any governing body and are not required to operate by any country’s know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws like centralized exchanges.
